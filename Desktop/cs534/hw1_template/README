Please finish all the TODOs in comments in the template code in the files below.

Files to finish and run:
- script_see_files.py is the script that you want to run to execute all your Python methods you need to finish
- data_loader.py is the file to load data from the data dir. The data dir should be where you put the corresponding
data from the arc challenge data set
- explore_data.py is the visualization code that will render the data to a plot and save (example is given to you in plots.

Please see the directory structure as well for where to put your data and plots

Please see the requirements.txt file for libraries to use.
If you are new to pip and venv, please see:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

There are many tutorials on the internet and usually your IDE makes it easy to setup.

Submission

Once done commit your code to GitHub in a subdirectory called "HW1"

Project: ARC Dataset Visualizer

This project processes and visualizes examples from the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) dataset. Given pairs of input-output grids, it generates plots for exploration and analysis.

Files Overview
	•	main.py: Walks through JSON files, processes them, and generates visualizations of input-output pairs.
	•	data_loader.py:
	•	walk_files(directory): Recursively loads JSON files from the directory and returns them as dictionaries.
	•	get_example_elements(json_example): Converts input-output pairs from JSON files into NumPy arrays for visualization.
	•	explore_data.py:
	•	visualize_explore(examples, title): Generates side-by-side plots of input and output grids, saving them to the ./plots/ directory.

Directory Structure

.
├── main.py
├── data_loader.py
├── explore_data.py
├── data/ARC-AGI/data/   # Dataset JSON files
└── plots/               # Output visualizations

Usage
	1.	Ensure your dataset is in ./data/ARC-AGI/data/.
	2.	Run the main script:

python main.py


	3.	Visualizations will be saved in the ./plots/ directory.

Example Visualization

The visualizer generates side-by-side plots of input and output grids, similar to the ARC dataset tasks. Each cell shows its value, and color-coding is used to enhance clarity.
